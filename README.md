# ComposeSelectableChart â€” a pie chart with possibility to select one specific segment.

This repository is just a showcase of using custom layouts and animations of Jetpack Compose.

I don't recommend you to use it in production, 'cause I didn't examine the performance.
But feel free to play, reuse and share.
